            // 2. Once you believe you have a good set of interfaces, then start creating your specific animal classes and have them implement the appropriate interface.

            // 3. Then define classes to represent the containers that will hold various animals. Each container class should have a single property - a list to hold animal instances.

            // 4. Lastly, in Main() create one (or more if you like) instances of each type of animal and each container. Then add the animals to their corresponding container.
